\begin{abstract}
This document describes a project for a machine learning/artificial intelligence based generation of music. It will rely mostly on developed projects and try to connect them to create \color{astral}AM.I.\color{black} With this project I want to create a platform that creates an ecology of musicians that create all of the products associated to music but everything through artificial intelligence.

\section{Introduction}

Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are getting to a point where they are able to do tasks that traditionally were thought to be only accessible to humans because they involve skills that are difficult to implement computationally such as intuition or creativity. Projects like AlphaGo have shown that intuition can be somehow encoded into a machine, at least for a particular game.

\section{The protopype}

Automated generation of music, covers, band name, lyrics, choosing genre, videoclips, partiture, musicians (with all their characteristics)... from an stimulus (words, images, or any kind of data).
